## Description [!]

Updated with the newest industry standards, our resume template asks only the important questions to let you quickly create a beautifully formatted resume. With the touch of a button, your resume will be downloaded and ready to send to your next dream job.

If the downloaded resume is misplaced, we've got that handled as well. Returning users can log in to view, edit, and download past saved resumes.

>*"A resume is an important tool for your job search as it offers a page or two where you can display your relevant skills and qualities for a job. Resumes help employers make hiring decisions and help you get your first interview. That's why it matters how you structure your resume and what information you decide to include."* - Indeed.com

__Disclaimer:__ Our template is specifically made for those seeking employment or advancement in the coding/web development industry. Certain questions within this form would not be applicable to other industries. This website focuses on the resume formatting and content only, and does not guarantee job placement or interview scheduling with any company. We hope this helps you!


### Motivation

The job search is daunting; we get it. Especially when changing fields. Created by five people who are empathic to this situation, this app aids all those who may have an uncertain but exciting future to unlock.

### What problem does it solve?

Our app caters specifically to those transitioning from another field and are new to the web development field. Our resume template also applies to those advancing or furthering their career in this field. We focus on transferrable skills with an emphasis on projects in the center of the resume.

At this time, the resume template is not applicable to industries outside of web development. We welcome your feedback, suggestions, or contributions, though!

### What did you learn?

Some npm packages and versions of those packages created some tangles at times. We learned to communicate effectively as a group to complete the project in a timely manner.

### What makes your project stand out?

Our simple, clean design partners with an effective, ready-to-use resume template to result in a powerful and practical website. We hope our users find their industry transition made a little easier if they choose to use our services.
